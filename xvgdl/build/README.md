# XVGDL BUILD

## Important Note
This `build` folder and its contents are not up to date. It is maintained here as it is referenced in the XML-based Video Game Description Language (XVGDL) paper, published in IEEE Access journal `http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639&source=authoralert`

This project is in continuous evolution so the _jar_ files in this folder do not contain the latest version of the code. For a new version of the artifacts to be generated, follow the usual maven project packaging, using the following command:

>mvn clean package --file xvgdl/xvgdl-def/pom.xml
