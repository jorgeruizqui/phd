XVGDL BREAKOUT definition
Being a quite complex example, the classic Atari Breakout videogame, has been used to demonstrate the use of XVGDL including concepts not covered by the Pacman
example like projectile items and objects speed.

A. Defining base game context
The Breakout map is surrounded by walls where a ball can bounce. In this example, the map will be created using a file which specifies the position of all elements in screen. Player controls a platform and has to avoid the ball falling to the floor trying to make all bricks on the map to disappear. That is the winning condition. The game begins with six rows of bricks, with every two rows a different color, for our example the bricks are Yellow (Y), Orange (O) and Red (R). For each of them, the score is different. Yellow bricks will disappear when they are hit, while the others are transformed. Orange bricks will be transformed into Yellow and Red bricks will be transformed into Orange. With this mechanism we can simulate that a brick needs a number of hits before it will be permanently removed from the screen.

Game Map
 A square map with a specific 2D size will be used for simulating the game board.
 Map is defined in a text file using objects initials letters to map all objects on screen. Game Engine is responsible for reading that map file and constructing the game map and objects according to that file. 

Game Objects: The list of objects present in the game are given.
 Walls: Objects on the map that can not be crossed by enemies or player. The map is surrounded completely by walls, so the ball can not pass the limits of the screen.
 Bricks: Distributed on the screen map, these bricks are the player objective. We declare them as items to represent that situation. Player should get all items to win the game.
 Platform: The player itself with an initial number of 3 lives. The platform is what the user controls, trying to always move the ball through the map, never reaching the map floor.
 Floor: Represents the enemy. If the ball touches the floor, the player will lose a life.
 Ball: Is the projectile the player will use to get all items (bricks) in the map.

Scheduled Events
 Ball speedup: Scheduled to be executed every S configured seconds, this event will be responsible for speeding up the ball, so the game will be more difficult as game time advances. 

Game Rules: Basic rules have been defined in order to simulate the Breakout video game. 
 Ball hits wall: Ball will bounce with random angle.
 Ball hits Yellow brick: Ball will bounce with random angle and the brick will disappear. Player score will be incremented by 100.
 Ball hits Orange brick: Ball will bounce with random angle and the brick will be transformed into a Yellow brick. Player score will be incremented by 200.
 Ball hits Red brick: Ball will bounce with random angle and brick will be transformed into an Orange brick. Player score will be incremented by 300.
 Ball hits platform: Ball will invert its direction.
 Ball hits floor: Ball will be moved to the platform position and player lives will be decreased 

Game End conditions Some basic end conditions have been added to make sure the game ends in certain situations.
 Lives zero: Player lost all his/her lives (not a wining
condition)
 All bricks are cleared: Player has collected all bricks in the map (Winning condition)
 Timeout: Configured timeout to limit gameplay.
